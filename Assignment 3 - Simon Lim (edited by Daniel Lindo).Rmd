## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#First, required package needs to be installed

#install.packages('vegan')
#install.packages('maps')

#Then packages are passed through the library function so we can use them

#Specimen data retrieval
# Anseriformes also known as waterfowl contain public data on BOLD.Public data as of 2023/09/22 consists of 2,371 published records forming 88 BINS, with specimens from 43 countries. These records include 2,213 species names, representing 133 species.  
#Below is the path used access data from BOLD
#http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/API_Public/specimen?taxon=Anseriformes&format=tsv
#BOLD specimen data is retrieved using read_tsv, from the BOLD website. . 
birdBOLD <- read_tsv( file = "http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/API_Public/specimen?taxon=Anseriformes&format=tsv")

#I then used write_tsv() to write the birdBOLD dataframe to a delimited file named "Anseriformes_BOLD_data.tsv
write_tsv(birdBOLD, "Anseriformes_BOLD_data.tsv")

#general information was gathered using names(), summary(), and length() to have an idea of what is contained in the data

#Generating an exploratory map of the Anseriformes BINs with lat and lon values in Canada and Argentina

#Using tidyverse format, I start with birdBOLD dataframe, filter for only rows where the country category is 'Canada' and 'Argentina', and filter to remove any NA values from the lat and lon categories. 
NAbirdBOLD <- birdBOLD %>%
  filter(country %in% c('Canada','Argentina')) %>%
  filter(!is.na(lat)) %>%
